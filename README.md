# WeatherDashboard

## Description
Weather Dashboard is an interactive weather app that allows you to enter in your city name, to display the current weather along with an additional 5 day forecast. Every search is then saved in local storage making it easy to switch back and forth from your favorite cities. The UV index is also presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
