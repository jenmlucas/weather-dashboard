# WeatherDashboard

## Description
HTML 
• Used to create elements for each section, such as Search for a City, Showing Weather for, Saved Searches, and the Five Day Forecast. 
• Optimized code by using Bootstrap classes to be able to organize the content with the html file. 

CSS
• Used Bootstrap to customize buttons, dates and icons. 

Javascript
• Created an interactive weather dashboard where you can enter a city name and get the current weather display plus an additional 5 day forecast. All searches also saved in localStorage.
• UV index presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
• Made the code easier to read by using some shorthand syntax.
